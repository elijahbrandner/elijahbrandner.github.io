summary: "Weather App (Spring Boot + MongoDB):
Built a full-stack weather application with user authentication, role-based access, and real-time weather data via REST APIs. I implemented MongoDB integration and backend logic while collaborating with a remote team using GitHub."
---
For our final group project in CST-339 (Advanced Java), my team built a dynamic full-stack weather application that allows users to register, log in, and search for current weather conditions by city. The application retrieves real-time data from a third-party weather API and presents it in a clean, user-friendly interface. We developed the project using Spring Boot for the backend, MongoDB for persistent storage, and RESTful services for weather data integration. Users were assigned different roles (user/admin), and session management was implemented to handle user state and secure content access.

As one of the back-end developers, I was responsible for setting up the MongoDB database and integrating it with our Spring Boot application. I implemented user authentication and role-based access control using encrypted credentials stored in MongoDB. I also contributed to the design and development of the REST controller that handled weather queries and external API calls. While working in a distributed team, we used GitHub for version control and task coordination, which gave me hands-on experience with pull requests, merging, and resolving conflicts in a real-world-style development workflow.

This project helped me grow in several areas, including back-end web development, NoSQL database integration, and RESTful API consumption. I also strengthened my collaboration and communication skills by working remotely with team members I had never met in person. Most importantly, I learned how to adapt when existing code or team decisions didnâ€™t align with my original approach, which is a key part of being a professional software engineer. Overall, this project gave me valuable experience working across the full development stack and showed me the importance of balancing technical depth with practical teamwork.
