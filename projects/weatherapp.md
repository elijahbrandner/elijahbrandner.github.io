summary: "Built a full-stack weather application with user authentication, role-based access control, and real-time weather data integration. Contributed primarily to backend development, MongoDB integration, and REST API logic while collaborating with a remote team."
---
This **Weather App** is a full-stack web application that allows users to register, authenticate, and retrieve real-time weather information by city. The application integrates data from an external weather API and presents it through a clean, user-friendly interface while enforcing secure access through authentication and role-based permissions.

The system supports multiple user roles, including standard users and administrators, with protected routes and session handling to ensure secure content access. The backend was built using Spring Boot, with MongoDB used for persistent storage of user credentials and application data. RESTful services were implemented to handle weather queries and external API communication.

This project was developed as part of a small remote team, simulating a real-world collaborative development environment. The team coordinated development using GitHub for version control, pull requests, and issue tracking, which required frequent communication and coordination across different parts of the system.

## My Role & Contributions
I primarily worked on the backend and data layer of the application, with a focus on authentication, database integration, and API logic.

Key contributions included:
- Designing and integrating MongoDB collections for user accounts and application data  
- Implementing user authentication and role-based access control with encrypted credentials  
- Developing REST controllers to handle weather search requests and external API calls  
- Assisting with backend application structure and endpoint design  
- Collaborating with teammates via GitHub pull requests, code reviews, and merge conflict resolution

## Key Takeaways
- Gained hands-on experience building backend services using Spring Boot in a team environment  
- Learned how to integrate and manage a NoSQL database (MongoDB) within a Java-based web application  
- Strengthened understanding of authentication, authorization, and role-based access control  
- Improved ability to collaborate remotely using GitHub workflows, pull requests, and shared codebases  
- Developed adaptability when integrating with existing code and team design decisions

## Potential Enhancements
- Adding caching to reduce redundant external weather API calls  
- Improving frontend visualizations for weather data and forecasts  
- Introducing location-based weather detection using browser APIs  
- Enhancing security with token-based authentication (e.g., JWT)
