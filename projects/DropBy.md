**DropBy** is a web-based event discovery platform designed to help people find and share local community events such as sports meetups, social gatherings, faith-based events, and casual hangouts. Unlike traditional social media feeds, DropBy focuses on simplicity and usability by presenting only essential event information—what’s happening, where, and when—while making it easy for users to RSVP or create their own events.

The application allows users to browse upcoming events, filter them by category, create new event listings, and RSVP to events they plan to attend. Authenticated users can view events they have RSVP’d for and manage their own event postings. The overall goal of the project was to reduce the friction of discovering local activities and encourage real-world community engagement through a clean, focused user experience.

This project was completed during July–August 2025 as part of a software engineering course and was developed by a four-person team. My role spanned multiple areas of the project, including contributing to the overall software architecture, working on both frontend and backend development tasks, and leading the creation and maintenance of project documentation. On the frontend, I helped implement core user flows such as browsing events, creating events, and RSVP interactions using React and TypeScript. On the backend side, I assisted with application logic related to event data handling and user interactions. I also played a key role in organizing documentation, structuring the GitHub Pages site, and ensuring project artifacts were clearly presented and accessible.

From an engineering perspective, DropBy emphasized collaborative development and milestone-driven delivery. The team used GitHub Project Boards to plan and track work across multiple milestones, breaking down features into manageable tasks and coordinating contributions through issues and pull requests. ESLint and Prettier were applied to maintain consistent coding standards, and the application was deployed using Vercel.
