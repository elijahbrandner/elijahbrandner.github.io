## Introduction
When I started ICS 314, I thought software engineering was simply the process of writing, creating, and maintaining software. By the end, I realized that’s still true — but it’s only the surface. Underneath is a deeper layer of habits, processes, and teamwork that turn “writing code” into “building software.”

It’s about practicing good habits that lead to consistent, reliable outcomes. It’s about working with a team, because you won’t always be coding alone. Real-world projects are often too big or complex for one person, which means communication, coordination, and awareness are essential. Tools like GitHub, issue tracking, and project boards aren’t just “extra” — they’re what keep everything moving in the same direction.

Time management is also a big part of the job. In a software engineering project, coding is only part of your day. You might also be in meetings, reviewing pull requests, writing documentation, planning features, or fixing bugs. If one deadline slips, it can affect the whole team — so staying organized is just as important as knowing how to code.

## Agile and Issue Driven Project Management
One of the biggest skills I picked up in ICS 314 was working with **Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM)**, a style of Agile Project Management. Agile is all about breaking work into smaller tasks and delivering them in short cycles so you can adapt quickly when things change. IDPM takes that idea further by tracking every task as an “issue” in a tool like GitHub.

What I liked most about IDPM was how visible progress became. At any point, I could look at the project board and see what was in progress, what was done, and what was still ahead. That visibility kept everyone aligned without needing constant check-ins.

I can see this approach working outside of web development too — organizing an event, managing a research project, or even planning a group trip. If there are multiple moving parts and people involved, having a clear backlog, assignments, and progress tracking makes all the difference.

## Git and Configuration Management
Before this course, I had only used Git in a couple of classes, so I was at least somewhat familiar. ICS 314 took it to another level. I learned how to create backup branches to experiment safely, resolve merge conflicts when histories diverged, and follow commit practices that prevent problems before they happen.

I also got more comfortable with GitHub Pages — hosting documentation or websites directly from a repository — and started seeing version control as more than just a coding tool. Git-style tracking could be just as useful for managing research data, maintaining a design portfolio, or collaborating on any kind of evolving document. If you need to know *who changed what, when, and why*, version control is the answer.

## Design Patterns
Design patterns are like muscle memory — once you’ve used them enough, they stop feeling like something you “apply” and start feeling like second nature. In ICS 314, I leaned heavily on **component-based design** in Next.js. Breaking a project into reusable pieces kept it organized and scalable, and pairing that with the **DRY principle** (“Don’t Repeat Yourself”) made my code cleaner and easier to maintain.

**Model-View-Controller (MVC)** also became second nature. Separating data, logic, and presentation made it easier to troubleshoot and add features without breaking everything else. The cool thing about patterns is that they give structure without limiting creativity — they’re tools, not rules. Part of becoming a better developer is learning when to follow them and when to bend them.

## Takeaway
One of the biggest things I’ll carry forward from ICS 314 is realizing that clear communication is just as important as technical skill. Writing clean code is great, but if you can’t explain your decisions, coordinate with others, or keep your documentation up to date, the project will eventually suffer.

This class also reinforced the importance of **reusability** and **maintainability**. Writing something once, writing it well, and reusing it saves time, reduces errors, and makes collaboration smoother. Our final project was a great example — the moments when we communicated well *and* built with maintainability in mind were when progress felt the smoothest. Those two habits go hand in hand, and I’ll take them with me into every future project.
