*Become: the process of coming to be something or of passing into a state.*

I first got into software engineering because I liked the idea of building things with code. At first, it was just about figuring out how to get things to work. But over time, I started to care more about how the code was written—how clean it was, how maintainable it was, and how everything fit together. I realized there's a lot more to software engineering than just writing code that runs. It’s about solving problems in smart ways, and writing code that others (including your future self) can make sense of, even when it’s not simple.

I see software engineering as a long-term challenge for myself. It’s not easy—and I don’t expect it to be—but I know it’s something I’m capable of understanding and improving at. Coding is a skill I want to polish. Sometimes, as a student, it’s tempting to shift my focus toward just finishing assignments rather than really learning the concepts behind them. But I want to go deeper than that. I want to understand what’s happening under the hood, and I want to develop the kind of skills that will stick with me outside of the classroom.

Right now, I’m really into full-stack development. I’ve done some backend work with Spring Boot and MongoDB, and I’ve enjoyed the challenge of connecting everything—from the database to the user interface. I want to get better at front-end development too, maybe learn React, and get more comfortable working across the whole stack. I’m also curious about DevOps and how tools like Docker or GitHub Actions can help automate and improve the development process.

In the future, I want to keep learning by doing more team projects, whether that’s in school, internships, or open source. Working on a team has already taught me a lot about communication, planning, and dealing with unexpected problems. I know that being a good software engineer means more than just being good at code—it also means being reliable, adaptable, and easy to work with. My goal is to keep improving and eventually work on projects that make a real impact. I know it’ll take time and effort, but I’m committed to learning and growing through each step of the journey.
