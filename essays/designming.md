When I first started programming, I didn't think much about design patterns. I thought they were formal things - something only "serious developers" really worry about. But over time, I have realized that I was following patterns without even realizing it. It's like building a house - you don't have to reinvent how a door works every time. You follow what has worked in the past and eventualy, it becomes second nature. 

As a student developer, my style is always evolving. It's hard to label myself as just one thing — I’m constantly problem-solving, learning new ways to approach challenges, and adapting what I see from professors, peers, or YouTube devs. When something clicks, like why a certain structure works — not just how — that’s when it really sticks. It’s like watching a huge puzzle fall into place.

Design patterns are exactly that: the puzzle pieces we reuse. They simplify decision-making. I’ve used component-based design a lot in Next.js — breaking down a UI into reusable parts, promoting separation of concerns, and avoiding messy repetition. That alone reflects patterns like MVC, DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), and shared component use. And it works — not just because it’s “the right way,” but because it makes my code more logical, organized, and scalable.

Even outside of UI, I’ve found myself naturally using patterns like the iterator (thanks to endless for loops), and factory-like setups when returning different types of users based on input. And I’ve followed structure in life too — at the gym, in my daily routines, in how I work through problems. There’s a pattern to getting better at anything, and development is no different.

The truth is, using patterns is about judgment. It takes experience to know when to follow a blueprint and when to break it. And sometimes, breaking a pattern is what leads to a better solution. That’s what makes this field so creative.
