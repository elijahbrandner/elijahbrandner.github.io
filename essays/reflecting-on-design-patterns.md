## The Invisible Framework of Every Project

When I first started coding, I didn't think too much about the way I structured things—I just wanted it to work. But over time, I started to notice something: the more I built, the more I started to **follow patterns**—even if I didn’t know their names yet. It's like we're not reinventing the wheel every time we start a new project. Instead, we build upon common practices, repeat what works, and improve what doesn't. 

In that way, design patterns are like **muscle memory**. You pick them up naturally while watching others—through WODs, YouTube videos, or even a professor's example—and eventually they become part of your own workflow.

## Recognizing the Patterns I Use

As a student developer, I realize I've used quite a few design patterns without even calling them that. For example:

- **Component-based design** in Next.js helps me separate logic and keep my UI clean and reusable.
- The **MVC pattern** (Model-View-Controller) gives me a way to organize my code logically when there's more than just UI involved.
- The **DRY principle** (Don’t Repeat Yourself) is something I always try to follow to reduce redundancy.
- Creating **shared components** instead of duplicating them is a pattern that promotes reusability and reduces future bugs.
- I've used the **Factory pattern** when creating methods that return different types of objects depending on the context (like different types of users).
- And of course, I’ve used the **Iterator pattern** for years without even thinking about it—because it’s basically what a `for` loop is!

It’s wild to realize just how many patterns have quietly become part of my toolbox.

## A Style That’s Always Evolving

I don’t think I can label myself under a single category of developer. All developers are **problem-solvers** and inherently creative—we have to visualize where we’re going, build from scratch, and adapt when things break. My approach to code is constantly evolving. Each “aha” moment—whether from my own curiosity or learning from others—helps me piece together more of the puzzle.

And it’s not just in programming. In life, too, I follow patterns and structure. My gym routine has steps. My days have flow. That’s what helps me stay consistent and grow.

## The Judgment to Know When to Break the Pattern

Sometimes, following a pattern can lead to a dead end. That’s where **judgment** and **experience** come in. You need to know not just how to follow a design pattern, but **when to adapt or break it**. That flexibility is what separates someone who can write code from someone who can build solutions.
