When learning a new programming language, all the new information can be overwhelming. There's new syntax, tools, and rules that all tend to blur together. For me, one thing that helps clear the fog is consistency. This is why I believe coding standards play a big role in learning a new language. If there's a predictable way to structure code correctly, it becomes easier to understand what's exactly happening and why. This structure gives you a mental framework to rely on and fall back upon. When it comes time to apply what you have learned, you don't have to waste energy deciphering a mess between different styles of code. You just utilize the standards that you have learned and practice, and they guide you.

This past week I was introduced to ESLint in VSCode. It's a tool that automatically flags sections of your code that don't follow certain standards. While I am still getting a grasp of everything that ESLint is capable of, I have already seen how useful it can be. The tool doesn't magically fix broken logic, but it will catch errors like using var instead of const, missing semicolons, or inconsistent indentation. These types of errors may not break your code immediately but can cause trouble down the line. Another positive is that the tool doesn't take much effort to use. It runs in the background and keeps your code clean as you go. 

Overall, I think upholding coding standards are one of the best ways to improve the quality of code. Repetition and consistency are very important when it comes to learning or mastering anything, and coding is no exception. Clean, consistent code is easier to debug, test, and maintain. It also may help when you revisit your own code days, weeks, or months later. It especially helps when your code is involved in a group setting.

With that being said, I do believe that with there's a room for flexibility within coding standards. If you're working on a solo project, I believe it's okay to utilize your own style sometimes. For example, whether you place opening curly braces on the same line or the next line may come down to personal preference. However, when working in a team, sticking to generally accepted standards is a significant practice. It makes collaboration smoother and your code easier for others to understand.

In short, coding standards aren't just about being picky about small details. They are about creating a shared language that helps everyone, including your future self, to read, understand, and improve code more easily. Tools such as ESLint help reinforce those standards with little effort, making them a practical piece of writing better software.
