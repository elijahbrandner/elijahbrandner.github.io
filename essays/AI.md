## I. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increasingly become an integral part of education, offering students new ways to learn, problem-solve, and create. In software engineering, AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT can act as real-time coding partners, research assistants, and debugging aids. Throughout ICS 314, my primary AI tool was **GitHub Copilot**, which integrated directly into my coding environment and offered in-line suggestions while I worked. Copilot often anticipated the code I intended to write, speeding up development without replacing my understanding of the material. I used **ChatGPT** occasionally for broader explanations, debugging help, and clarifying concepts that Copilot couldn’t fully explain. Together, these tools became valuable supplements to the course’s lectures, WODs, and projects.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

**1. Experience WODs (e.g., E18)**  
For assignments like E18 or E49, Copilot provided in-line code completions as I typed. For example, when working on TypeScript array methods, Copilot would sometimes suggest exactly the filter/map logic I had in mind, letting me move faster. ChatGPT came in when I needed to double-check syntax or logic, such as:  
> "In TypeScript, how do I combine `map` and `filter` on an array of numbers?"  
This was helpful but still required adjusting to fit the WOD’s constraints.

**2. In-class Practice WODs**  
During practice WODs, I mostly relied on Copilot for small syntax hints. If I started typing a function and hesitated, Copilot would often complete the rest, matching my intended logic. This was useful for keeping momentum without stopping to search the web.

**3. In-class WODs**  
I avoided AI here since the purpose was to test my independent skills under time pressure. I wanted to challenge myself to recall concepts without external help.

**4. Essays**  
For essays like E63 (Reflect on Design Patterns), I occasionally used ChatGPT to help brainstorm a clear structure:  
> "Help me outline an essay about MVC and reusable components in Next.js."  
From there, I wrote the content myself to ensure it reflected my own thoughts and experiences.

**5. Final Project**  
In the DropBy project, Copilot was especially useful for speeding up repetitive code, like generating form-handling logic or writing fetch requests to Supabase. ChatGPT came in when I needed clarification on topics like:  
> "How do I query data from Supabase in a Next.js API route?"  
I adapted these examples to work with our authentication flow.

**6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial**  
When learning Bootstrap and Next.js, I sometimes asked ChatGPT:  
> "Explain how to create a responsive navbar using Bootstrap in Next.js."  
This helped bridge the gap between documentation and real-world usage by showing me examples I could experiment with.

**7. Answering a Question in Class or Discord**  
I didn’t really use AI for this. Most Discord conversations I participated in were about due dates or assignment requirements rather than technical troubleshooting.

**8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question**  
I occasionally used ChatGPT to polish my wording before posting a technical question, making sure it was specific and clear enough to get useful answers from classmates or instructors.

**9. Coding Example**  
At one point, I asked ChatGPT for:  
> "An example of a basic Next.js `src/app/page.tsx` layout."  
It provided a working structure, which made it easier to understand how to organize components and imports.

**10. Explaining Code**  
If I didn’t understand a particular Next.js routing example, I would paste it into ChatGPT and ask:  
> "Explain what’s happening in this file line-by-line."  
This helped me quickly connect the dots between syntax and functionality.

**11. Writing Code**  
Copilot often completed the exact code I was about to write — such as form validation logic, loops, or database queries — without me needing to fully type it out. It didn’t replace my own logic but made the process significantly faster.

**12. Documenting Code**  
When documenting functions in the DropBy project, I occasionally pasted code into ChatGPT with the request:  
> "Generate JSDoc comments for this function."  
This saved time but still required review for accuracy.

**13. Quality Assurance**  
If I encountered ESLint errors, I could paste them into ChatGPT with:  
> "Here’s my code and the ESLint errors — fix them."  
It often fixed the issues instantly, though I always tested afterward to ensure nothing broke.

**14. Other Uses**  
Being fairly new to Git, I used ChatGPT to help me understand commands for pull requests, pushing code, or handling merge conflicts:  
> "What’s the step-by-step process for pulling the latest changes from main into my branch in Git?"  
This gave me confidence in my workflow without spending too much time searching through different Git guides.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding
AI in ICS 314 helped me move past sticking points that might have otherwise slowed my progress for hours. It was especially helpful in **researching unfamiliar concepts** like Next.js routing, Bootstrap components, or even basic HTML — since this was my first time coding HTML in depth. Copilot kept my workflow smooth, while ChatGPT provided deeper explanations when I needed to step back and learn. Together, they improved my comprehension, allowed me to build confidence faster, and often got me out of tough spots when I was stuck for too long.

## IV. Practical Applications
Outside of ICS 314, AI has been just as valuable. In CST-239, I’ve used it for debugging Java and quickly recalling syntax. More broadly, I use ChatGPT as a research tool for learning new skills like sports, surfing, diving, and weightlifting. It helps me keep track of step-by-step processes and even build personalized diet plans for optimal nutrition without manually calculating everything myself. In many cases, ChatGPT acts as a faster, more interactive alternative to Google — letting me find relevant information in one conversation instead of sifting through multiple websites.

---

## V. Challenges and Opportunities
The main challenge with AI was that Copilot sometimes suggested incomplete or incorrect code, and ChatGPT occasionally provided outdated information. However, these moments became learning opportunities — I learned to double-check AI output and adapt it to my needs. In the future, I see opportunities for AI to be integrated into coursework as a deliberate skill, teaching students not just how to code, but how to work effectively with AI.

---

## VI. Comparative Analysis
Traditional methods like lectures and documentation build the foundational skills needed to code without assistance, while AI-enhanced methods boost efficiency and provide alternative perspectives. My best learning came from blending both — first attempting problems independently, then using AI to refine, validate, or expand my solutions.

---

## VII. Future Considerations
AI will likely play a greater role in real-time debugging, personalized learning paths, and automated code reviews in software engineering education. I believe future courses could explicitly teach students how to use AI critically, treating it as a skill just like version control or testing.

## VIII. Conclusion
In ICS 314, GitHub Copilot was my main AI partner, and ChatGPT acted as my occasional research assistant. Used together, they improved my productivity, deepened my understanding, and made learning more engaging. My recommendation for future courses is to guide students in AI use — not to replace independent problem-solving, but to enhance it.
