## I. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has slowly worked its way into education, and now it’s everywhere. For software engineering especially, it’s like having an extra teammate who never sleeps. In ICS 314, I leaned on **GitHub Copilot** as my main AI tool, and only pulled out **ChatGPT** when I needed a deeper explanation, a second opinion, or a quick research boost. Copilot lived right inside my code editor, finishing lines for me, sometimes even before I finished thinking them. ChatGPT, on the other hand, felt more like a “sit down and talk it out” type of assistant. Between the two, they made learning smoother, but never fully replaced the work I had to put in.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

**1. Experience WODs (e.g., E18)**  
When I was doing WODs like E18 or E49, Copilot would often guess exactly what I wanted to write. For example, I’d start typing some `map` and `filter` logic, and before I could finish, it would complete the rest. ChatGPT only came in when I got stuck and needed something spelled out, like:  
> "In TypeScript, how do I combine `map` and `filter` on an array of numbers?"  
Helpful, but still required tweaking for the WOD’s rules.

**2. In-class Practice WODs**  
Copilot here was just a speed boost. I’d start writing a function, pause, and boom — it filled in the rest in a way I was already planning to do. Nice when the clock’s ticking.

**3. In-class WODs**  
Copilot was again just a speed boost here. Definetely helped with meeting the time requirements. However, I tried to limit the usage of copilot in these assignments. Part of the challenge was seeing if I could actually do it on my own, under pressure.

**4. Essays**  
When I wrote essays like E63 (Reflect on Design Patterns), ChatGPT was my brainstorming partner:  
> "Help me outline an essay about MVC and reusable components in Next.js."  
I still wrote it myself, but the outline made it easier to start.

**5. Final Project**  
For DropBy, Copilot was my go-to for repetitive code — form handlers, fetch requests to Supabase, things like that. ChatGPT helped me understand things Copilot couldn’t explain, like:  
> "How do I query data from Supabase in a Next.js API route?"  
From there, I adapted the example to our setup.

**6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial**  
When I was figuring out Bootstrap and Next.js, I asked ChatGPT:  
> "Explain how to create a responsive navbar using Bootstrap in Next.js."  
That gave me a working example without having to dig through multiple docs.

**7. Answering a Question in Class or Discord**  
Didn’t really use AI for this. Most of my Discord conversations were about due dates or assignment requirements.

**8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question**  
Sometimes I’d use ChatGPT to make my questions cleaner before asking in class or posting in Discord. It was just easier to get a good answer if the question was clear.

**9. Coding Example**  
At one point, I asked ChatGPT for:  
> "An example of a basic Next.js `src/app/page.tsx` layout."  
This gave me a better sense of how files should be organized.

**10. Explaining Code**  
If I had code I didn’t fully get (like some Next.js routing examples), I’d paste it into ChatGPT and say:  
> "Explain what’s happening here line-by-line."  
Made it way easier to connect the dots.

**11. Writing Code**  
Copilot was fast here. I’d start typing and it would sometimes finish the whole loop, query, or function I had in mind. I still knew what I wanted to write — it just saved me a few keystrokes.

**12. Documenting Code**  
When I needed to write JSDoc comments in DropBy, I’d sometimes paste the function into ChatGPT:  
> "Generate JSDoc comments for this function."  
It saved time, but I always reviewed for accuracy.

**13. Quality Assurance**  
For ESLint issues, I’d paste the code and errors into ChatGPT:  
> "Here’s my code and the ESLint errors — fix them."  
Quick fixes, but still had to test afterward.

**14. Other Uses**  
Since I’m still new to Git, ChatGPT was handy for commands I didn’t fully remember:  
> "What’s the step-by-step process for pulling the latest changes from main into my branch in Git?"  
Made things less intimidating than digging through Git docs.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding
AI in ICS 314 was like a safety net. If I got stuck for too long, I could ask a question, get unstuck, and move on. It helped me research unfamiliar concepts like Next.js routing, Bootstrap components, or even basic HTML (since this was my first real dive into HTML). Copilot kept my momentum going, and ChatGPT filled in the gaps when I needed more context. Together, they didn’t just speed me up — they made me more confident.

---

## IV. Practical Applications
Outside ICS 314, AI has been just as useful. In CST-239, I’ve used it for Java debugging and quick syntax checks. Outside of school, I use ChatGPT to research sports, surfing, diving, and weightlifting techniques, or to create step-by-step plans like personalized diet guides. Honestly, it’s like a faster, more direct version of Google — no jumping through multiple links, just straight answers in one conversation.

---

## V. Challenges and Opportunities
Copilot isn’t perfect — sometimes it guesses wrong, and ChatGPT can give outdated info. But that just means I’ve learned to double-check and not blindly trust AI output. There’s a lot of potential here: AI-powered code reviews, live debugging help, and automated test writing could all be integrated into future courses.

---

## VI. Comparative Analysis
Traditional methods (lectures, documentation, peer help) build the foundation. AI speeds up the process and gives you other ways to solve the same problem. My best results came from combining both — trying things myself first, then using AI to polish or troubleshoot.

---

## VII. Future Considerations
AI’s role in education will only grow — I can see it being part of real-time debugging, adaptive learning systems, and even grading. But I think it should be taught like any other skill: how to use it effectively without becoming dependent on it.

---

## VIII. Conclusion
In ICS 314, GitHub Copilot was my main AI teammate, and ChatGPT was my occasional research partner. They helped me move faster, understand more, and feel less stuck. If future courses teach students how to use AI critically and effectively, I think it’ll be as essential as learning Git.
